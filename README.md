# -SoC-Project-NLPlay-with-Transformers-

This is a Learning Project and has been divided into 3 phases:

**Phase 1:**
* Introduction to NLP
* Introduction to `PyTorch`
* Creating a Sentiment Classifier using Neural Network
* Learning about `RNNs`, `LSTMs` and `GRUs`
* Implementing LSTM for Sentiment Analysis

The Sentiment Analysis has been carried out on the IMDB Movie Review dataset which consists of 50,000 reviews,
and is divided equally into positive and negative reviews.
The models have been made by utilizing the PyTorch framework.

**Phase 2:**
* Introduction to Attention in Deep Learning
* Introduction to Transformers and their working
* Learning about Transformers like `BERT`, `RoBERTa`, `XLNet` & `DistilBERT`
* Creating a Sentiment Classifier with BERT architecture
* With the BERT architecture in place, replaced the Model and Tokenizer with:
  * `distilbert-base-uncased` (DistilBERT)
  * `roberta-base` (RoBERTa)
  * `xlnet-base-cased` (XLNet)


**Phase 3:**
