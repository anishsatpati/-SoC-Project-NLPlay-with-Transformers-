This is a Learning Project and has been divided into 3 phases:

Phase 1: 
* Introduction to NLP
* Learning PyTorch
* Creating a Sentiment Classifier using Neural Network
* Learning about RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs
* Implementing LSTM for Sentiment Analysis

The Sentiment Analysis has been carried out on the IMDB Movie Review dataset which consists of 50000 reviews,
and is divided equally into positive and negative reviews.
The model has been made by utilizing the PyTorch framework.
